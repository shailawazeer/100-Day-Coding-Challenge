# 100-Day-Coding-Challenge
## Welcome to My Daily Coding Challenge!  <br>
Hi there! I'm Shaila, a second-year Computer Science student eager to sharpen my coding skills.
Let's be honest, consistent practice is crucial for improvement, but sometimes it can feel a bit... well, routine. To keep things interesting and fun, I've decided to challenge myself with a daily coding spree!

**Why this Challenge?**  <br>

This challenge is all about taking my coding skills to the next level. By dedicating some time each day to tackle problems from platforms like LeetCode or HackerRank, I hope to:

* **Sharpen my problem-solving skills:** Coding challenges are fantastic for learning how to break down complex problems into manageable steps.  <br>
* **Deepen my understanding of coding concepts:** Each problem will be a chance to explore new algorithms and data structures, solidifying my grasp of core programming concepts.  <br>
* **Become a more efficient coder:** As I solve more problems, I aim to improve my ability to write clean and efficient code.  <br>

**Join the Journey!**  <br>

This challenge isn't just for me! I extend a warm invitation to all coding enthusiasts, developers, and anyone passionate about programming to join me on this adventure.  <br>

* **Connect:** Let's stay connected! Follow me on LinkedIn (Shaila wazeer) for daily updates on my coding solutions and to engage in insightful discussions.  <br>

**Let's make the next 100 days incredible! ðŸš€**  <br>

I'm excited to share my progress, learn from others, and build a vibrant coding community. Together, we can make these 100 days count and embark on a fantastic coding adventure!  <br>
